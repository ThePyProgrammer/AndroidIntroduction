# Android Self Introduction App
Part of Lab 0 in the CS4131 Module at NUS High School

This application shows a profile for myself, showing a simplistic main profile, a page for interests and a view for my GitHub profile.

While rather simplistic, this app serves as an introduction for me to Android App Development, and I would like to thank Mr Ng for setting this interesting lab for me and my fellow students.
